# 🤖 Deep Research Agent

The **Deep Research Agent** is a powerful, autonomous multi-agent system designed to perform deep web research, strategic planning, and generate professional-quality reports — all within seconds.

This project leverages modern Agentic AI architecture, combining the power of LLMs, asynchronous workflows, and coordinated agent handoffs to streamline the research process.

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

The system is composed of **four key intelligent agents**, each with a specialized role, all orchestrated by a **Research Manager**:

### 1. 🗂️ Planner Agent
- Interprets the user’s query
- Generates a structured web search plan with specific objectives

### 2. 🌐 Search Agent
- Executes real-time web searches
- Collects context-aware information for each planned item

### 3. ✍️ Writer Agent
- Synthesizes search findings
- Crafts a clean, coherent summary from raw content

### 4. 🧠 Research Manager
- Orchestrates the entire pipeline
- Ensures smooth handoffs between agents
- Applies guardrails to ensure reliable, traceable outputs
